  --resource-group myRG \
  --locations regionName=eastus failoverPriority=0 \
  --locations regionName=westeurope failoverPriority=1 \
  --default-consistency-level Session
```

---

### üîÄ Consistency Levels (5 Models)

| Level         | Latency | Throughput | Data Freshness | Guarantee                        |
|---------------|---------|------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Strong        | High    | Low        | Real-time      | Linearizability                  |
| Bounded Staleness | Medium | Medium     | Defined lag    | Order + Bounded freshness        |
| Session       | Low     | High       | Per-session    | Monotonic reads/writes per session |

| Eventual      | Lowest  | Highest    | Asynchronous   | No ordering guarantees           |

> **FAANG Tip**: Use **Session** for most transactional apps; **Bounded Staleness** for analytics with consistency needs.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Partitioning 101

- **Partition Key** determines data distribution
- Cosmos creates **logical partitions** (by key) grouped into **physical partitions** (containers)
- Proper key choice is **mission-critical**:
  - High cardinality
  - Uniform access pattern
  - Avoid hot partitions

#### Example (Order Management)
```json
{
  "orderId": "123",
  "customerId": "C001",
  "region": "us-east",
  "items": [...]
}
```
- Good partition key: `customerId` or `region`

---

### üì¶ Request Units (RU/s)
- Abstracts CPU, IOPS, memory cost into a single unit
- Each operation (read/write/query) consumes RU based on payload
- You **provision** RU/s per container (manual or autoscale)
- Monitor & tune with **Azure Monitor**, **Metrics**, or **SDK logs**

---

### üõ† Hands-On Setup
- Deploy with Azure Portal or CLI
- Use **Cosmos DB Emulator** for local dev
- SDKs available in .NET, Node.js, Java, Python, Go

#### Sample Query (SQL API)
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders o WHERE o.customerId = 'C001'
```

---

### üß† FAANG-Level Scenarios

1. **E-commerce Catalog**: Globally consistent product inventory, replicated across regions
2. **IoT Telemetry**: High-velocity inserts using time-series partition key (deviceId + hour)
3. **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Use `tenantId` as partition key + Row Level Isolation via app layer

---

## üìò Cosmos DB Mastery ‚Äì Phase 2: Data Modeling & Partitioning (FAANG Level)

Data modeling in Cosmos DB isn't just about structure ‚Äî it's about **performance, scale, cost, and long-term maintainability.** Poor decisions here cause massive throughput issues, high RU consumption, and hot partitions at scale. This phase will shape your Cosmos foundation like a FAANG architect.

---

### üéØ Objective
- Design schemas optimized for Cosmos DB's distributed nature
- Choose ideal partition keys for performance and scalability
- Handle denormalization, embedded vs referenced entities
- Analyze partition heat and model multi-tenant and time-series workloads

---

### üß† Schema Design Philosophy
Cosmos DB is a **NoSQL, document-based** store ‚Äî you must design with:
- Access patterns first
- Write optimization second
- Partitioning always in mind

> üö´ Don't normalize like SQL
> ‚úÖ Embed when you read together

---

### üîÑ Embedding vs Referencing

#### üî∏ Embed
```json
{
  "orderId": "O123",
  "customerId": "C456",
  "customer": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@demo.com"
  },
  "items": [...]
}
```
- ‚úÖ Fewer reads
- ‚úÖ Higher performance
- ‚ùå Data duplication
- ‚ùå Update complexity

#### üî∏ Reference
```json
// Order
{
  "orderId": "O123",
  "customerId": "C456"
}

// Customer
{
  "customerId": "C456",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@demo.com"
}
```
- ‚úÖ Centralized updates
- ‚ùå Extra queries (joins must be client-side)

> üß† FAANG Strategy: Embed for transactional reads, reference for admin/data ops use cases

---

### üîë Partition Key Design
Your partition key **defines scalability**. Cosmos routes each request based on it.

#### Ideal Partition Key Qualities:
- High cardinality (many unique values)
- Evenly distributed workload
- Included in most read/write queries

#### Bad Partition Key:
- `Country` (few unique values ‚Üí hot partition)
- `OrderStatus` (low cardinality, skewed writes)

#### Good Partition Key:
- `userId`, `tenantId`, `deviceId`, or `orderDateHour`

#### Time-Series Strategy:
```json
"_pk": "device001|2024-04-14T09"
```
- Combines **device ID + timestamp bucket** for even load

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Partitioning Mechanics
- **Logical partition**: Group of items sharing the same key
- **Physical partition**: Storage + compute unit (~20GB or 10K RU/s max per physical partition)
- Cross-partition queries = more RU and latency

#### üîç How to Detect Partition Hotspots
- Azure Portal ‚Üí Metrics ‚Üí "Normalized RU Consumption per Partition"
- SDK logs / diagnostic telemetry

---

### üîÅ Modeling Patterns

#### 1. **Multi-Tenant SaaS**
- Partition by `tenantId`
- Add Row-Level Access logic in app/API layer

#### 2. **E-commerce Catalog**
- Partition by `categoryId` or `brandId`
- Embed product variants inside main document

#### 3. **IoT Time-Series**
- Partition by `deviceId|hour` or `region|minute`
- TTL to expire documents after 30‚Äì90 days

---

### üß† FAANG-Level Scenarios
1. **Read-Heavy SKU Search**: Denormalize inventory metadata per SKU for fast search
2. **High-Write Logging System**: Avoid cross-partition writes with intelligent key prefix
3. **Chat Application**: Use `chatRoomId` as partition key, embed last N messages

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Tasks
- Model a CRM system with embedded `contacts` and partitioned by `accountId`
- Build a multi-tenant DB where each tenant sees only their data

```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.customerId = 'C001'
```
- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN` (limited)
- **No server-side joins across partitions**

#### üî∏ Projections & Filters
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.email FROM c WHERE c.status = 'active'
```
- Use projection to reduce RU cost

#### üî∏ Cross-Partition Queries
```sql
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.timestamp > '2024-01-01'
```
- Allowed **only if explicitly enabled**
- More expensive (query fan-out)

#### üî∏ Pagination
```sql
SELECT * FROM c OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10
```
- Use continuation tokens for SDK-based paging

---

### üß† Indexing Model

#### üî∏ Default Behavior
- Every property automatically indexed
- Indexing = space + RU cost

#### üî∏ Custom Indexing Policy
```json
{
  "indexingMode": "consistent",
  "includedPaths": [
    { "path": "/name/?" },
    { "path": "/email/?" }
  ],
  "excludedPaths": [
    { "path": "/*" }
  ]
}
```
- **Include only queried fields** to optimize RU/s
- **Composite indexes** for ORDER BY with filters
- **Spatial & range indexes** for location-aware queries

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Cosmos SDK (Performance Tuning)

## üìò Cosmos DB Mastery ‚Äì Phase 7: Advanced Integration & Event-Driven Architectures (FAANG Level)

In this phase, Cosmos DB shifts from being just a storage engine to acting as the **backbone of reactive systems.** You‚Äôll master change feed, stream processing, and serverless integrations ‚Äî vital for event sourcing, CQRS, and microservice choreography.

---

### üéØ Objective
- Leverage change feed for real-time event processing
- Integrate Cosmos DB with Azure Functions, Event Hubs, and Kafka
- Architect materialized views and data pipelines
- Enable CQRS and reactive designs with Cosmos

---

### üîÑ Change Feed: What & Why
- Emits every **insert and update** (no deletes) in order by `_ts`
- Pull-based or push-based subscription models
- Reads from **within a partition key range** for ordered processing
- Ideal for syncing, auditing, projections, and downstream alerts

#### Modes:
| Mode        | Method                                  | Use Case                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pull        | SDK/Processor reads changes continuously | Custom stream consumers       |
| Push        | Azure Functions trigger per new change   | Serverless event processing   |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Azure Functions Integration

#### Trigger Setup (JavaScript)
```js
module.exports = async function (context, documents) {
  documents.forEach(doc => {
    context.log(`New change detected: ${doc.id}`);
  });
};
```
- Bind Cosmos DB with trigger type = `cosmosDBTrigger`
- Scales automatically per RU/s and partition feed rate

---

### üîÅ Event Hub & Kafka Integration
- Cosmos DB ‚Üí Change Feed ‚Üí Event Hub ‚Üí Kafka, Stream Analytics, or Spark
- Use Azure Data Factory or Custom Worker
- Use `lease container` to manage stateful checkpoints (pull pattern)

#### Example: Cosmos ‚Üí Event Hub
1. Cosmos ‚Üí Azure Function ‚Üí Event Hub
2. Event Hub ‚Üí Kafka, Data Lake, or Analytics Workspace

---

### üß± Materialized Views & CQRS
- Use change feed to populate read-optimized views
- Examples:
  - Flattened customer profile
  - Order status dashboard
  - Summary document aggregates

#### CQRS Architecture:
- **Write Model**: Inserts to Cosmos (raw commands)
- **Read Model**: Updated by change feed projections (denormalized views)

---

### üß† FAANG-Level Scenarios

1. **Real-Time Fraud Detection**
   - Change feed triggers risk engine per transaction
   - Results posted to Kafka via Event Hub

2. **Blazing Fast Dashboards**
   - Change feed builds real-time views for UI
   - Read models are latency-optimized documents

3. **Audit Log Streaming**
   - Insert-only tracking of user updates
   - Export to cold storage or compliance logs

---

### ‚úÖ Practice Tasks
- Create an Azure Function to process change feed and log output
- Build pipeline from Cosmos ‚Üí Event Hub ‚Üí Storage
- Construct materialized view (e.g., daily sales total)
- Implement checkpointed change processor using SDK

---

### üì¶ Deliverables
- Function trigger template (Cosmos DB bindings)
- Change feed projection framework (Node/.NET)
- CQRS design blueprint with Cosmos-specific considerations
- Integration pipeline YAML (Event Hub + Function)
