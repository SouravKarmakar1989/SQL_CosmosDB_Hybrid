# üìÖ Week 6 ‚Äì Polyglot Persistence & System Design Patterns

üß† **Learning Goal**: Learn to architect real-world systems that leverage both Cosmos DB and SQL strategically, applying best practices in persistence choice, integration, and cloud-native design.

üïí **Daily Time Budget**: 2‚Äì3 hours

---

## üóì Day 1: Polyglot Persistence ‚Äì When to Use SQL vs NoSQL

### üéØ Objectives
- Learn architectural patterns for combining SQL and NoSQL effectively
- Understand the strengths and trade-offs of relational vs non-relational systems
- Use decision matrices to choose the right database engine for a workload

---

### üîç Key Concepts
- **Relational Databases (SQL)**:
  - ACID compliance, relational joins, strong schema enforcement
  - Best for structured, transactional workloads
  - Mature ecosystem (OLTP/OLAP, reporting, integrity)
- **NoSQL (Cosmos DB APIs)**:
  - Schema-flexible, horizontally scalable, eventual consistency
  - Best for high-ingest, large-scale, or rapidly evolving data models
  - Query limitations vary by API

---

### üîß Architecture Patterns
- **Polyglot Backend**:
  - Use SQL for billing/analytics, NoSQL for session/user data
- **Write vs Read Store Split**:
  - Write-heavy data to Cosmos, analytical layer in SQL
- **Transactional + Eventual Hybrid**:
  - SQL for financial data; Cosmos for customer activity streams

### üß† Deep Dive: SQL vs NoSQL Trade-off Matrix
| Dimension         | SQL (Relational)         | NoSQL (Cosmos DB)             |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Schema           | Fixed schema (strict)     | Dynamic (flexible JSON)       |
| Scaling          | Vertical / read-replica   | Horizontal / partitioned      |
| Transactions     | Full multi-row ACID       | Limited or partition-scoped   |
| Consistency      | Strong                    | Configurable (5 levels)       |
| Indexing         | Fine-tuned, custom        | Auto-indexing by default      |
| Latency          | High for joins, low for PK| Very low on key reads         |
| Use Cases        | OLTP, OLAP, reporting     | IoT, gaming, social, session  |

  - Aggregates in Cosmos ‚Üí denormalized joins in SQL
  - Change Feed from NoSQL ‚Üí update warehouse

---

### üîß Hands-On
- Model an e-commerce domain in both SQL and Cosmos DB
  - SQL: Customers, Orders, Products (3NF)
  - Cosmos: Orders container with embedded product summary
- Write equivalent queries in T-SQL and Cosmos SQL API
- Compare query shape, latency, and update logic

```sql
-- SQL Orders Table (Normalized)
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
  OrderDate DATETIME
);

-- Cosmos Order Document (Embedded)
{
  "orderId": "123",
  "customerId": "C001",
  "products": [
    { "sku": "P100", "price": 29.99 },
    { "sku": "P200", "price": 59.99 }
  ]
}
```

| Joins                | Native                        | Manual or embedded references    |
| Denormalization      | Avoided unless for perf       | Preferred for read speed         |
| Updates              | Trickle updates via FK logic  | Must update nested documents     |
| Reporting            | Views, Materialized Views     | Change Feed to downstream sinks  |

## üóì Day 3: Transaction Patterns ‚Äì ACID, BASE, Idempotency

### üéØ Objectives
- Understand the differences between ACID and BASE models in SQL and NoSQL systems
- Design reliable transaction flows with idempotent write patterns
- Implement retry-safe, partial failure-resilient operations across systems

---

### üîç Key Concepts
- **ACID (SQL)**:
  - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
  - Multi-table, cross-row transactional support
  - Serializable and snapshot isolation
- **BASE (NoSQL)**:
  - Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
  - Writes may propagate asynchronously
  - Data anomalies expected without strong constraints
- **Cosmos DB Transactions**:
  - Limited to a single logical partition (stored procedure or batch API)
  - Cannot span collections or partitions
- **Idempotency**:
  - Crucial in distributed environments
  - Ensures safe replays or retries of the same operation
  - Implemented via unique keys, versioning, state checks

---

### üîß Hands-On
- Run a SQL transaction for order placement + inventory decrement
- Simulate the same in Cosmos using transactional batch (same PK)
- Implement retry logic with idempotency token (e.g., Order ID)
- Use Cosmos stored procedure to validate partial rollback logic

```sql
-- SQL Transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO Orders (...) VALUES (...);
  UPDATE Inventory SET Quantity = Quantity - 1 WHERE ProductID = 'P123';
COMMIT;
```

```json
// Cosmos Batch (same partition)
[
  { "operationType": "Create", "resourceBody": { ... } },
  { "operationType": "Replace", "id": "P123", "patchBody": [ ... ] }
]
```

---

### üß† Deep Dive: Reliability Pattern Matrix
| Pattern                      | SQL (ACID)           | Cosmos (BASE + Idempotency)       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Multi-Entity Write          | Supported (any rows) | Only within same partition         |
| Read-Modify-Write           | Transactional        | Needs ETag or conditional writes   |
| Retry on Failure            | Rollback on error    | Use retry policy + idempotent key  |
| Audit Trail                 | Built-in (logs, triggers) | Manual or Change Feed based  |
